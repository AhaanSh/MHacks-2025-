# Design Document: Rental Housing Platform

**Target Audience:** This document is a guide for agents and developers to build a user-facing platform that simplifies the rental process for hopeful tenants.

## 1. Core Design Philosophy

Our platform's design is guided by the principles of simplicity, clarity, and trust, inspired by mymind.com's minimalist and private aesthetic. The goal is to relieve the stress of finding rental housing by creating a calm and intuitive user interface. We will avoid visual clutter and complex navigation, allowing tenants and agents to focus on the essential task of finding and securing a home.

## 2. Layout & Structure

The platform will utilize a card-based, search-first interface. The main user experience will revolve around a clean, elegant display of property listings in a grid format, similar to mymind.com's content cards.

* **Homepage:** A prominent, central search bar will be the primary entry point for tenants. Below it, a curated selection of featured listings can be displayed in a clean, scrollable grid.
* **Listing Pages:** Each property will be presented as a detailed card containing high-quality images, key information (rent, bedrooms, address), and clear call-to-action buttons.
* **Agent Dashboard:** Agents will have a minimalist dashboard where each of their listings is a card. This provides a clear, at-a-glance view of their active properties.
* **Intuitive Workflow:** The entire process, from finding a listing to submitting an application, will be broken down into simple, manageable steps, each presented in a straightforward, "card-like" flow. There will be no complex menus or hidden sub-pages.

## 3. Typography

We will use a modern, readable sans-serif font to maintain the platform's clean and elegant feel. The chosen typeface should be highly legible at various sizes and on different devices.

* **Headings:** A bold or semi-bold variant for titles and section headers to ensure key information stands out.
* **Body Text:** A regular-weight font for property descriptions, application forms, and all other text. The goal is readability and a sense of calm.

## 4. Color Palette

The color scheme will be neutral and warm, creating a feeling of security and homeliness. We'll use a mostly neutral background with pops of warm, inviting colors to highlight key actions and information.

* **Primary Background:** A soft white or light gray (#f5f5f5) to create a clean, minimalist canvas.
* **Primary Text:** A dark gray (#333333) for high readability.
* **Accent Colors:** Use warm, earthy tones like a muted orange (#ff9966) or a soft gold (#cc9900) for buttons, active links, and status indicators. These colors will guide the user's eye and add a touch of personality and warmth without being overwhelming.
* **Interactive Elements:** Buttons and other interactive elements should change color slightly on hover or click to provide clear feedback to the user.

## 5. Key Hackathon Pages

Given this is a demo to show feasibility, the following pages will be built with the highest priority, following the design principles above.

### Dashboard
The dashboard is the central hub for the user, designed to feel like a personal command center. It will use a clean, gridded layout of card-based modules for:
* **Favorited Listings:** A visual grid of the user's favorite properties, each as a card with a high-resolution, full-bleed image.
* **Chatbot Conversations:** A grid of chat cards, each showing a preview of the last message exchanged with the bot.
* **AI-Native Email Alerts:** A card providing a feed of communications with landlords or agents, with an icon to indicate new messages.

### Chatbot Page
The chatbot interface is the platform's core interactive element. The design will be simple and elegant, focusing on the dialogue and the listing cards the bot provides.
* **User Interface:** A minimalist chat window, with messages presented in a clean, sans-serif font.
* **Listing Presentation:** The MCP agent will generate a rich, interactive listing card directly within the chat window when it finds a property that matches a user's criteria. This card will include key details and a concise summary of how it aligns with the user's specific requirements.
* **User Actions:** Below the listing card, clear, distinct call-to-action buttons will allow the user to favorite the listing or contact the landlord.

### Google Maps Integration
To maintain the clean, minimalist aesthetic, the map integration will be subtle. When a user taps on the address in a listing card, a small, elegant modal window will pop up, displaying a map centered on the property's location.

## 6. Additional UI/UX Elements

* **High-Quality Photography:** High-resolution photos are critical. The design will dedicate significant space to imagery on listing cards, mimicking the visual-first approach of mymind.com.
* **Icons:** Use a consistent set of simple, elegant line-art icons to represent features like bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities.
* **Subtle Animations:** Employ subtle animations for transitions between screens and for interactive elements, which adds to the platform's sophisticated feel without being distracting.
